            <h3>6 Degrees of Separation</h3>
            <p>It is said that all people are but six steps away from each other by way of introduction. It's possible to see the phenomena in the scienfitic community as well: scientists often collaborate with many of their colleagues, who in turn may work with even more collaborators. Find out how tightly or loosely any two scientists are connected through their webs of coauthors.</p>

            <h3>Publisher Relationships</h3>
            <p>Publishing channels, as well as scientists themselves, each have their own sets of focus areas and specializations. Looking across researchers and journals can provide valuable insight on how the scientific community organizes into specialized groups by examining the relationships between them.</p>
